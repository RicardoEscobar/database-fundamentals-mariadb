    <h1>Understanding databases</h1>
    <div class="exampleBorder">
        <p class="null_text_indent"><span class="dropcaps1">W</span>hat's the problem? There is data to store. You may need to store customer names and addresses, maybe a list of products and their prices, maybe just a balance sheet for accounting, maybe list of employees. Whatever it is, you have to store it somewhere. But here is the thing: you can already store data in text files and spreadsheets. So, just having data is not the problem. What comes next to having data, is the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="id1">What are databases?</h2>
        <p>Before looking at database engines and their features, you need to realize that databases where created to solve a problem. You may have some information that you may like to store, so most programmers see databases like a file to get their data into. However this is just half truth. Most databases offer solutions to not just storing data. If that was the case, you may just store the names, telephone numbers and adddress of your customers into a spreadsheet or even a text file. So just having the data is not enough reason to have a database. So, what comes next?</p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Size</li>
            <li>Updating the data</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>Redundancy</li>
            <li>Importance</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="key">Size:</span> Many small businesses start with a spreadsheet, and continue working like that for many years. That may work perfectly when there are a thousand lines, but what happens when you get five million lines? Then it's not so quick to even open the application, let alone look for anything. Having small amounts of data is not a solution specially when the business grows. Your solution should be able to grow alongside the business.</p>

        <p><span class="key">Updating the data:</span> What happens if more than one person needs to edit the spreadsheet at the same time? You may say that sharing the file may be a good idea, but you'll end up with everyone overwriting everyone else's changes. Each of them may have a copy of the spreadsheet and problem solved right? Then you step into the next problem, consolidate all those changes into a single master file that everyone needs to copy over again in order to get everyone else's changes. Just too much work, and with a lot of room for mistakes. And that's just two people, just imagine how complex it would be if there are ten people at the same time, or five hundred people at the same time.</p>

        <p><span class="key">Accuracy:</span> What's preventing me from entering wrong data? what if I introduce a customer twice? what if I introduce a date where a price amount is requiered. What if I miss some important piece of information like a name or a phone number? As the business grows older, these files get insonsistent and validation of data is lackluster or non existent. You can't just trust the data.</p>

        <p><span class="key">Security:</span> And just because you need to share business information with someone, it doesn't mean you need to share it with everyone else. This data may be sensitive information like: financial and banking information (in my case), maybe medical records, payroll information. So who get's to even see the information? in my case, with financial and banking information there are laws to abide for, and most of the time you'll eventually get a visit from an external auditor that will demand you to get him a detailed story of not just the data but who inserted or modified the data and when.</p>

        <p><span class="key">Redundancy:</span> Better known as duplication of data, it's not really a bad thing to have. You are going to be asked to create backups of the business data and there are tools that help you do just that. Having copies of the data is not a bad thing. But redundancy in the data itself is. If you have a product catalog and the price for a product says it costs $100 and another entry says it's $50, which one is it? Maybe this information is owned by two or more departments or offices and one product cost one price in one site and have an updated price in another, so which one is the true price?</p>

        <p><span class="key">Importance:</span> It may already happened to you, you get a network disconnection that makes you lose a game match, or just an energy failure that makes you lose half an hour of work or even a day of work. Maybe the program crashed and you lose a two hour audio recording, and that's annoying and inconvinient. But if you lose the payment record of your customers, or the medical records of a patiente or just lose the banking transactions of an entire day, that's not inconvinient, that's unacceptable. That's better know as critical data, in many businesses, data is the business, you can't lose anything, not a single change.</p>

        <p>You may have some or all of these problems, so databases are not about where to put your data, we can already do that. Databases are about what comes next: </p>

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scalable: The date may grow and still be able to be manageable.</li>
            <li>Accessible: The data needs to be easly inserted and updated by many people at the same time.</li>
            <li>Accurate: Keeping the data consistent with reality.</li>
            <li>Secure: Who gets to see the information and who get's to write the information. And know who did what and when.</li>
            <li>Consistent: There must be one version of the truth.</li>
            <li>Permanent: Once you make a change in the data, that change remains permanently, unless the business decides it's time to delete it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what a database offers. A structure to not just store our data, but to define a place to put our data and even rules to abide when entering data. The rules are yours to decide. Maybe your needs are different from someone else's, maybe you have a lot of information and need a way to store it and search for it in a quick manner. Maybe you have much less data but you need to log everything that happens to it. And because of this that if you had only worked with a database that somebody else designed and build, you may be losing sight of what's really important and think that a database is like a spreadsheet but it's more difficult to use. And that's not it at all. The solutions a database offers are ofthen overlooked by many just because they are not really visible to a lot of people not even software developers. The security, the multi user support, the indexing and easy or searching. This and many more valuable features are offered by databases, they can even survide shutdown or crashes and remain reliable after a reboot.
