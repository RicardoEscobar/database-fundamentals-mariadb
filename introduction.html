    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div class="exampleBorder">
        <p class="null_text_indent"><span class="dropcaps1">A</span>nd the reason I'm about to write this book, is because I want you to get the database administrator job, and do it well. And because I have the time now that I'm not in an actual job. For this purpose I chose MariaDB as both learning and production database, meaning that whatever you learn with MariaDB will be relevant at the workplace. Most teachers choose a desktop database like Microsoft Access or Filemaker, but I don't recommend doing that. Most people won't use those anyway since they have limitations that make even Microsoft itself recommend SQL server instead of Access for production database deployment.</p>

    <h2 id="id1">Welcome</h2>
    <p>If you are a newcommer to databases, welcome. You are at the right place. If you are an experience user of databases, you may feel the inclination to skip the beginners content of the book, but I ask you to read it as well, you are probably using a database more than creating one, for this reason parts of this book may teach you one thing or two that you may not exercise constantly at the job.</p>

    <p>Starting a database administrator job is quite hard, specially if it's your first one. And the preasure to perform at a professional level as soon as possible, is more than enough for you to go nuts. and you are not alone. I already spend eleven years of doing just that, I been doing the database administrator job for that long and I can say for sure that it's the main reason why most developers get a hard time developing.</p>

    <p>Most software developers focus on the visual and business side of the software, most of the time software developers and programmers think about databases like a hard to use spreadsheet. And they also know that working with databases it's innevitable. Whatever project your comapny want's to get done, more likely than not, it'll require a database to store data in a structured way. My objective it's to get you started as a professional database administrator that your boss would love and promote.</p>

    <p>We'll start at the beginning, learning about what actually is a database? and why would you want to work with one? And what problems do databases help you solve?</p>

    <p>There are several NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra, but most jobs are into the classic, relational databases and that's what we are going to focus. You'll learn the trade by making, We'll be working with creating tables, inserting data, making queries to the database and get information in a simple way. Once you get the hang of the very basics, we'll get into the more basic stuff that many software developers just ignore, like normalization, join tables in queries, and relationships between tables.</p>

    <p>Well be doing actual work with real world problems and how to solve them. I'm a business driven developer, so no tic tac toe games or guessing numbers games here, I'm going to revisit my dreadful past and cover the real challenges that you'll likely face at the job. I'll guide you and all code challenges and exercices are already solved with a detailed explanation of everything that there is in the code. So, let's get to work</p>

    <h2 id="id2">What you need to know</h2>
    <p>There are no requirements for this book, we'll be working at a beginners level, yet you'll find value at knowing basic programming with any modern programming language. When I mention variables, loops, conditional statements, functions and arrays, you may not feel confortable, if that's the case, you may look into a fundamentals of programming book or course. Even if I don't cover those subjects here in detail, I'm explaining their use in the real of a database, so you don't need to be a programmer to get value from the book.</p>

    <p>We are going to use MariaDB as our database engine, if you don't know what that is, don't worry. Most people commit to their first database for a long time, it happened to me, so I think that MariaDB is ideal for learning and keep using it in a professional enviroment. Learning with something easier like Miscorsoft Access or SQLite, may sound like a great idea because it's easy, but most jobs out there are with databases that support more than one user at the time. Whatever you learn with MariaDB, you'll be able to use for years to come, and even translate your MariaDB skills to other SQL relational databases like: MySQL, SQL server, Oracle, Postgres, etc.</p>

    <p>It doesn't really matter what operative system you use, Windows, MacOS and Linux, have access to MariaDB installers. The skills you'll learn here will be applicable to whatever app or program your company needs a database for.</p>
