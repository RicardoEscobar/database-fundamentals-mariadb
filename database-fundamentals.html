    <h2 id="id1">The features of a relational database</h2>

    <p>So a table is the fundamental building block of any database. A table is a formal structure to store data. It defines not just where the data should be stored, but what kind of data can be stored. A table may contain a lot of information but always about the same thing. A database table is often represented as a spreadsheet, with columns and rows, a table may contain several rows of information, but differently to a spreadsheet, a database table can't hold whatever kind of data into it.</p>

    <p>A table specifies types of information for every column on the table. So if you wish to insert text data in a colum for storing customer's names, you need a text colum for that, If you wish to store a date, you need a date type column for that too. These are part of the rules you wish to impose on the data, seems limiting at first, but imagine that you want a column for storing product prices, then you would not like to have text like &quot;$15.50&quot; instead of a number like &quot;15.5&quot;. This is because even if they seem the same, you can't just add text data without parsing such text as a number first. It can be done, but why bother?.</p>

    <p>As simple as this employee table may seem, the reality is that there are rules in place and the database engine it's going to enforce them. For example, the hire date may only store date data types, you can't just type whatever text you want there and hope that the database knows what to do with it. In fact, the database engine won't allow you to insert anything that's not an actual date into that field.</p>

    <p>You may look at the employee table and think that this looks pretty much like a spreadsheet, but there is nothing farther away from the truth. Spreadsheets are created with a different use case in mind. Databse tables are not serving just to a single user, but to a multitude of users, and the data stored must comply to the database's rules or else, error and exceptions will arise.</p>

    <h2 id="id2">Exploring unique values and primary keys</h2>
    <p>Let's say that you have a table with actual data on it, you may wonder how do we find anything? That's why we have unique values called <span class="key">keys</span>. A key is a value that allows you to identify an specific row on a table, it's actual value it's unique for that specific row on the entire table and does not apper for that column on a different row, that's why it's called <span class="key">unique value</span>. Sometimes an actual column on the table contains a <span class="key">natural key</span> like an employee number, which by nature of the data itself, it's just a single value for a single employee.</p>

    <p>To ilustrate, look at the employee table. We don't have a unique column but we have unique values, not two people are named the same, yet that doesn't mean we should just enforce this as a rule at the database engine level. Even if we find an employee by selecting him or her by his or her name, the reality is that if the company is big enough you may find yourself with two or more people sharing the same name. Below you have a new version of the employee table.</p>

    <p>There is a new column named <span class="key">employeeID</span> which is a unique column, that means that whatever value you insert into that column, will be unique for that particular row on the entire table. There is also a new employee named <span class="key">Jessica White</span> and even when there is already another employee sharing the same name, you can see that her <span class="key">hire date</span> and <span class="key">salary</span> are not the same. Yet if you want to find a particular individual, you should use select the employee by his or her <span class="key">employeeID</span> value.</p>

    <p>The employeeID column is used as an identifier, so you can look for a specific employee just by using this value as a search parameter. This is explained in detail in the chapter: <a href="querying.html">Querying.</a></p>

    <p>You may find yourself that the date itself may not contain a natural ID key, for example an email address is often used as a natural key on many tables, but what happens if the date itself doesn't have a natural key value? You need to create one yourself like in the case of employeeID, most database engines already help you doing this, they even ask if you want to define a <span class="key">primary key</span>, which is basically the database unique identifier for that table's rows. To finish, I recommend you to always create a primary key yourself, even when you have data like security number or even a unique email address, often you'll find out that having a reliable primary key that is unique to the table and inserted automatically by the database engine, will save you a lot of problems in the future, specially when we get into the chapter: <a href="normalization.html">Normalization.</a></p>

    <p>Primary keys are really important, they not only identify each row on a table, they are also used to link tables together.</p>
