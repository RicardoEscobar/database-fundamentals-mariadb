    <h2 id="id1">The features of a relational database</h2>
    <p>A database is build from tables. A database without tables is useless, not only there is no data, but there is no place to put data in.</p>

    <p>So a table is the fundamental building block of any database. A table is a formal structure to store data. It defines not just where the data should be stored, but what kind of data can be stored. A table may contain a lot of information but always about the same thing. A database table is often represented as a spreadsheet, with columns and rows, a table may contain several rows of information, but differently to a spreadsheet, a database table can't hold whatever kind of data into it.</p>

    <p>A table specifies types of information for every column on the table. So if you wish to insert text data in a colum for storing customer's names, you need a text colum for that, If you wish to store a date, you need a date type column for that too. These are part of the rules you wish to impose on the data, seems limiting at first, but imagine that you want a column for storing product prices, then you would not like to have text like &quot;$15.50&quot; instead of a decimal number like &quot;15.5&quot;. This is because even if they seem the same, you can't just add text data without parsing such text as a number first. It can be done, but why bother?.</p>
