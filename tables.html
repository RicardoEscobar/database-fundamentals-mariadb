You want to have the requirements of your database, that'll allow you to cover the basics and build incrementally rather than fixing something that serves no purpose.</p>

    <h2 id="id1">Introduction to database modeling</h2>
    <p>In databases, changes are possible but they are painful. And changes have different levels of difficulty. Is not the same to add something new, than to change something directly that has been in place for a long time.</p>

    <p>Planning your database become really important, just as building your house, you may like to know what your actual needs are in order to meet them, it's really annoying and difficult to keep moving forward if the requirements of the system change constantly.</p>

    <p>A table is not only a place to put your data in, it's a mechanism to set your rules upon the data, so the database can enforce them. A table is not open ended like a spreadsheet, you must define not only how many columns do you want and their names, but you also want to define what type of data you want your columns to store.</p>

    <p>In software development, we tend to work with agile methodologies in today's job market, and planning is different in such environments, little planning lead to little increments in software code base, yet it is still a requirement, although you may feel a little creative and may like to try fun ways to write software, I'm advising you to avoid this behavior while working with databases. the reason is that databases are not the place to try new things or fun ways of doing such things, creating and designing a database is craft that has been done for around fifty years already, most design choices had been tested and approved for decades now. So I ask you to reconsider and to redirect this creative energy to the graphical user interface, or the app, or the front end. A database is not a place to be playful or creative, a database must work correctly and should enforce rules that may stand before the test of time.</p>
